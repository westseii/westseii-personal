        "My name is Scott, and I was born and raised in the Quad Cities. I began modding video games as early as 1998 when I discovered a lone executable file for a level design tool (Worldcraft) hidden away on my physical copy of Half-Life. Ever since then, I've known I wanted to be creating things, be it through art, design, or code.",
        "During my mid twenties, I decided that there were more interesting things to do with my life than just work and play video games all the time. Four years ago, I returned to college to pursue a degree in computer science and this past May I finally obtained that degree from the University of Iowa.",
        "Although Iowa is where most of my family and friends are, I am eager to leave the area and begin pursuing other exciting opportunities."
