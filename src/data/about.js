    <p class="indent">With a background in art, design, and code, I've been passionate about creating things since my first dive into modding video games in 1998. This started a lifelong curiosity, leading me to explore new ways of bringing my ideas to fruition. After a brief pause exploring my other interests, I decided to return to school to earn a degree in computer science, a milestone I achieved this past May from the University of Iowa. As an individual who thrives on continuous learning and development, I am excited to leverage my skills, immerse myself further into the world of software engineering, and contribute to innovative projects in the technology sector.With a background in art, design, and code, I've been passionate about creating things since my first dive into modding video games in 1998.
